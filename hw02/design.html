<h1>User-First Designs</h1>
<p>
	<strong>As a new User, I should be able to create a new account</strong><br>

	There should be a clearly marked register button on the homepage the user can press,
	after which they can put in basic information such as username,
	password, and email. Then a button should be available to submit the 
	information and create the account<br><br>

	<strong>As a user, I should be able to follow other users</strong><br>

	If I see another user whose content I enjoy, I should be able to click
	into their profile, and there should be a button that allows me to
	follow them to see all of their new content.<br><br>

	<strong>As a user, I should be able to post my own blog posts</strong><br>

	There should be an available text field that allows me to write a post
	and a button to allow me to publish it to the public. This should be available
	if I am logged in and looking at my own account, or on the page where I can
	see all other user's posts.<br><br>

	<strong>As a user, I should be able to tag other users and use hashtags</strong><br>

	If there is another user they would like to mention, or a popular
	topic they would like to reference, they should be able to do so in their posts. 
	the &#64; sign would allow users to reference other users,
	and they can use the &#35; sign to mention a specific topic.<br><br>

	<strong>As a user, I should be able to view other users posts</strong><br>

	If I see a user I should be able to click onto another user
	and view their page, along with all of their previous posts.
